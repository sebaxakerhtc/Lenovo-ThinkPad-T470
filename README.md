## What works:
- CPU Undervolting
- Dual Battery (X220 Battery patch) 
- All function keys working with yoga SMC
- Intel HD 620 Graphics
- Fan control (Fan stops at low temp below 60 and starts working above 55 automatically, not to worry)
- Touchscreen (VoodooI2C) - disabled it because it works like a f**king gaint touchpad!
- Power management (CPU friend data)
- Wi-Fi (Intel Wi-Fi 8265)
- Bluetooth 4.0 (Intel Wi-Fi 8265)
- USB C & Thunderbolt 3 (Hot plug not work, device should be connected before boot to work)
- Apple HD Audio (ALC id=29 but not 47, because 47 gives unwanted buzzing noise when 3.5mm jack connected)
- Sleep (works perfect!)
- wake works (no issues with resuming services like BT and wifi etc)
- SD Card slot
- Handoff and Continuity (idk, I don't use it)
- AirDrop (idk, I don't use it)

## What doesn't work:
- FingerPrint Reader (no implementation)
- HDMI (Will work through USB C / Thunderbolt Hub pass-through)
